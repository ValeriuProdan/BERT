# BERT
Chatbot helping with order placements

Usage:
Create a folder in google drive "Facebook_bAbI". If you want to use another name you will have to change the paths in code that contain "drive/My Drive/Facebook_bAbI/"
If you do not have "best_bert_base_task5-2_12_classW.hdf5" then run the bert notebook to train the weights. 
If you have "best_bert_base_task5-2_12_classW.hdf5" you can run directly all the cells in the ChatBot notebook and use it.
